This repository demonstrates an uncommon Python bug involving a masked ZeroDivisionError exception. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` aims to handle division by zero by checking if either x or y is zero. However, it fails when both are zero, leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution illustrates how to correctly handle this scenario by explicitly checking for both conditions.
